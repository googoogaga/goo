;; Promise example...

(parsevm
 
 )


;; ------------------------
;; Bogus pseudocode follows:

(def remote-function (find-capsule "add1"))
(def my-promise (promise remote-function))

(my-promise 1)

;; Such pcode clearly indicates the need to be able to use capsules functionally.  Eg, they must have an input and an output.
