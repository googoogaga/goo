ISSUE: definition names

REVISION HISTORY:

STATUS: OPEN

RELATED ISSUES:

CATEGORY: change

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

current definition special form names are unpronouncable as words.
also the definition doesn't look like the usage.

PRINCIPLES:

names should be pronouncable words.

definitions should look like their usage.

PROPOSAL:

(DG f (...))        -> (DEF f (GEN (...)))
(DF f (...) ...)    -> (DEF f (FUN (...)))
(DM f (...) ...)    -> (DEF (f ...) ...)
(DV x ,v)           -> (DEF x ,v)
(DV (TUP x ...) ,v) -> (DEF (TUP x ...) ,v)
(DS (f ...) ...)    -> (DEF `(f ...) ...)

(LOC ((f (...) ...) ...) ...) -> (LOC (((f ...) ...) ...) ...)

EXAMPLES:

QUESTIONS:

does LOC has too many parentheses?

can one get into trouble with a free floating GEN?

does this jive with object-oriented namespaces?
